# Text-to-Knowledge-Graph

A Streamlit app that uses GPT (via LangChain) to extract a knowledge graph from descriptive text and visualize it as an image.

#### ðŸš€ Try the demo:
https://text-to-knowledge-graph.streamlit.app/

(Note: the main dev is poor so if you cannot test this out, it means she ran out of OpenAI credit. You can wait for her to deploy a model herself or reproduce the project with the instructions below.)


## Features

- Paste any descriptive text and generate a knowledge graph using GPT-4.
- Visualizes entities and relationships as a directed graph.
- Node colors represent different entity types, with a legend for clarity.
- Raw GPT output is displayed for transparency.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-knowledge-graph.git
cd text-to-knowledge-graph
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Secrets

Create a .streamlit directory and a `secrets.toml` file for your OpenAI API key:

```
.text-to-knowledge-graph/
  .streamlit/
    secrets.toml
```

Add your OpenAI API key to secrets.toml:

```toml
[default]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
```

### 4. Run the App

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Paste your descriptive text into the input box.
2. Click **"ðŸ§  Generate Knowledge Graph"**.
3. View the extracted graph and raw GPT output.

## Project Structure
